# Geo-tagged-tweet-collection-and-visualization

**Lab2**

Twitter data was retrieved using official Twitter API. A reference to the data crawling tutorial: https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog458/tree/master/labs/lab02

For this project, I wanted to explore how often people post twitter about "TikTok". So I used the filter keyword "TikTok". By observing the data, I find that there are a lot of comments made by people every five minutes, but only a small part of them are having geographical location. So I ran it five times to get more data with the geographic location. After doing data visualization, I found a relatively high number of publications on "TikTok" in the United States during the same period. But the results are somewhat limited due to time zone differences.

Therefore, through this exploration, I found that when we only select keywords, we can try to run more crawlers to get more useful data with the positions in them. And we can use QGIS to clip to our designated area.
